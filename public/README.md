# Public Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by Vite.

## Usage

Place your logo files and other static assets here. They will be accessible at the root URL:

- `public/logo.png` → `/logo.png`
- `public/favicon.ico` → `/favicon.ico`
- `public/images/logo.svg` → `/images/logo.svg`

## Notes

- Files in this folder are copied as-is during build
- Use relative paths in your code: `/logo.png` (not `/public/logo.png`)
- This folder is ideal for:
  - Logos and brand assets
  - Favicons
  - Images referenced in HTML
  - Other static files
